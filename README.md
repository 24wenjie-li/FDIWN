# FDIWN-Pytorch
This repository is an official PyTorch implementation of our paper "Feature Distillation Interaction Weighting Network for Lightweight Image Super-Resolution". (AAAI 2022)

## Paper can be download from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08655">FDIWN</a>. 


## Prerequisites:
1. Python 3.6
2. PyTorch >= 0.4.0
3. numpy
4. skimage
5. imageio
6. matplotlib
7. tqdm


## Dataset

We used DIV2K dataset to train our model. Please download it from <a href="https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/">here</a>.

Extract the file and put it into the Train/dataset.

Only DIV2K is used as the training dataset, and Flickr2K is not used as the training dataset !!!
